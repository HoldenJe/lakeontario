  rawtow,
  reduceresolution = "10s",

\arguments{
\item{rawtow}{a dataframe of temp and depth values}

\item{reduceresolution}{a smoothing parameter. Default = 10s}

\item{rollmeanstat}{a value that indicates how many seconds the rolling mean should be caluclated over}

\item{rollmeanmaxchange}{a value that indicates the max change in mean between values}

\item{mindepthallowed}{the minimum depth that the tow is expected to be in}

\item{max_dist_from_max_dep}{the maximum depth change the max depth and when the tow is still likely to be on bottom}
}
\description{
Input a list of rsk files that have been imported using `importRBR` to generate tow statistics
